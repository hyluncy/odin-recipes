**Recipe book** 

_Idea for project taken from The Odin Project, created by Erik Trautman_

This project will be a simple recipe book, coded using basic HTML. Concepts such as the basic HTML outline, links, images, pages, and lists will be used. 

While the main purpose of this project is to practice using HTML, I will focus on practicing git commits and creating meaningful, but concise git commit messages.
