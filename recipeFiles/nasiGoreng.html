        <h2>Description</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Nasi goreng is essentially Indonesia's take on fried rice. In addition to kecap manis, the country's ubiquitous sweet soy sauce, terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste) is what sets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you'll see in other countries.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Spice Paste: </h4>
            <li>2 small shallots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 medium cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 large fresh green chili, stemmed and seeded OR 1 tsp sambal oelek</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste)</li>
            <h4>Nasi Goreng: </h4>
            <li>4 cups cold cooked Jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 tbsp canola OR sunflower oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp kecap manis, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Ground white pepper</li>
            <h4>Serve with: </h4>
            <li>2 large fried eggs, sunny-side-up OR over easy</li>
            <li>Sliced cucumbers</li>
            <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fried shallots</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the Spice Paste: Add half the shallots to a mortar and grind with pestle until a coarse pur√©e forms. Add remaining shallots, followed by garlic, chile, and terasi (if using), grinding with pestle until each ingredient is mostly incorporated before adding the next. The final paste should resemble thick oatmeal in texture. Alternatively, combine all spice paste ingredients in a small food processor and process until they form a paste.</li>
            <li>For the Nasi Goreng: If using day-old rice, transfer rice to a bowl and break rice up with your hands into individual grains.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add spice paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of wok or pan to prevent paste from burning, until a pungent smell permeates your kitchen and paste turns a few shades darker, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium at any time if paste appears to be browning too quickly.</li>
            <li>Add rice to wok and stir to coat with spice paste. Add kecap manis and soy sauce. Stir and cook until rice is evenly colored and hot throughout. Season with salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Divide rice between two plates and top each plate of rice with a fried egg. Garnish with cucumber and tomato slices and shower with fried shallots, if you like. Serve immediately with kecap manis alongside for drizzling.</li>
        </ol>
