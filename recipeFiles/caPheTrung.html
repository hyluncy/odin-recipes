        <h2>Description</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The Vietnamese take on this treat makes for a dessert coffee, a silky concoction comprised of a sweet eggy foam floating atop of a cup of dark brew. Imagine a tiramisu in beverage form, and you will likely get pretty close to the vibe of a good egg coffee. Just a few minutes of work might make you a believer in egg coffee as its delicious flavor and texture might make your morning coffee look in need of that oomph.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Foam: </h4>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h4>Coffee: </h4>
            <li>2 oz (60 g) French roast coffee, finely ground</li>
            <li>4 1/8 cups hot water</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Make the Eggy Foam: </h4>
            <li>Combine the egg yolks, condensed milk, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat with the wire whisker on high for about 10 minutes. The appearance should be similar to a cake batter, not especially frothy.</li>
            <li>To test for the right consistency, spoon a small amount of the foam on top of a glass of water. If it floats it has the right consistency. If not, whip it for a few more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h4>Assemble the Egg Coffee: </h4>
            <li>Brew the coffee according to your preferred method. Reserve about half a cup for later use.</li>
            <li>Divide the remaining brewed coffee among 4 to 6 cups. If desired, set each cup in a small bowl of hot water to prolong the warmth of the coffee.</li>
            <li>Gently spoon some of the whipped egg foam onto the top of each coffee, 1 to 2 tablespoons per cup.</li>
            <li>Pour a bit of the reserved coffee through the foam in each cup. Dust with cocoa powder if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
